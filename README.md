# ChromaKeyer #
This is an automagic chroma keyer I developed as a part of a project. Tries its best to turn a background color into a transparency layer with minimal manual input.

This program uses some clues to determine precisely color is the background color and generates a transparency layer.

## How to use it ##
Copy `ChromaKeyer.cpp` and `ChromaKeyer.hpp` in the folder of your project, make sure you include OpenCV Core libraries and compile your project.

## Disclaimer ##
Long time I haven't build this project so I don't quite remember how do it. Please understand.
